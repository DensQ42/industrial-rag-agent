def download_file(url: str, name: str, mode: str = 'wb', overwrite: bool = False) -> None:
    """
    Downloads a file from a URL and saves it to the raw data directory.

    This utility function handles file downloads with automatic directory creation,
    duplicate checking, and error handling. It is designed for downloading datasets
    and other resources needed for data analysis pipelines, ensuring that files
    are properly saved in the designated raw data folder structure.

    The function includes overwrite protection to prevent accidental re-downloads
    of existing files, and provides clear status messages about download progress
    and file locations.

    Args:
        url (str): The complete URL of the file to download. Should be a direct
            download link that responds to HTTP GET requests.
        name (str): The filename to use when saving the downloaded file. Should
            include the appropriate file extension (e.g., 'data.csv', 'model.pkl').
        mode (str, optional): File writing mode for saving the downloaded content.
            Use 'wb' for binary files (default) or 'w' for text files. Defaults to 'wb'.
        overwrite (bool, optional): Whether to overwrite existing files with the
            same name. If False, skips download when file already exists. If True,
            always downloads and replaces existing file. Defaults to False.

    Returns:
        None: This function performs file operations but does not return any value.

    Raises:
        requests.HTTPError: If the HTTP request fails (non-200 status code).
        IOError: If there are issues writing the file to disk.
        requests.RequestException: For network-related errors during download.

    Note:
        - Creates '../data/raw/' directory structure if it doesn't exist
        - Uses pathlib.Path for cross-platform file path handling
        - Prints status messages for user feedback on download progress
        - Binary mode ('wb') is recommended for most file types to preserve integrity
        - File existence check prevents unnecessary re-downloads by default
        - Response content is written in full after complete download
